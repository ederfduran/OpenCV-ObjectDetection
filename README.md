# OpenCV-ObjectDetection

**TOOL SET:**

* macOS Mojave
* CMake and Make (Build Project)
* vsCode (Editor)
* lldb (Debug, https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac)
* OpenCV 4.1 + (QT Support) https://github.com/opencv/opencv

# Description 

This is the first step in object recognition algorithm. In this code we will preprocess and then apply segmentation for an image. Notices this is a very basic example with no complex data.

**Pre-Process**
* Noise removal.
* Light removal.(Using light pattern, ex. dividing or subtracting the original image and the same image without the object)
* Binarization.(Applies a fixed-level threshold to each array element)

**Segmentation:** We have two options to apply objects segmentation:
* Find Contours
* Connected Components

There are some important things to notice here:

* /vscode is a folder generated by vsCode to set up the debug functionality.Also has a c_cpp_properties.json to help the intellÂ¡sense to find the headers. Make sure you set up these files according with your directories. (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/c-cpp-properties-schema-reference)
* CMakeLists.txt used to build the project. Notice i build from source the OpenCV library.

# Steps to run

On Project folder :

```sh
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./ObjectDetection <image dir> <light pattern> // for this particular case ./ObjectDetection ../img/test_noise.pgm ../img/light.pgm
```
**Note:** CommandLineParser is used to read the input, there are some optional parameters in program execution, from better understanding refer to : https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d0/d2e/classcv_1_1CommandLineParser.html

To specify all input parameteres should be like this: 
```sh
./ObjectDetection ../img/test_noise.pgm ../img/light.pgm -lightMethod=0 -segMethod=2
```
